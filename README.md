- `oop/` - Classes and inheritance exercises
- `collections/` - Working with Java collections

### `/solutions/`
Complete solutions for all exercises (instructor reference)

### `/demos/`
Live coding demonstration files:
- `StringDemo.java` - String operations
- `ArrayDemo.java` - Working with arrays
- `ClassesObjectsDemo.java` - OOP concepts
- `CollectionsDemo.java` - Collections framework
- `FizzBuzz.java` - Classic programming exercise
- `JShellCommands.txt` - JShell demo commands

### Documentation
- `SETUP.md` - Environment setup instructions for students
- `VSCODE_PLAIN_JAVA.md` - Guide for non-Maven/Gradle projects in VS Code
- `TESTING_APPROACH.md` - Testing without external dependencies
- `slides.md` - Slidev presentation slides (optimized for screen fit)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code integration and project context

## For Instructors

### Running the Course
1. Send `SETUP.md` to client IT department ahead of time
2. Use `slides.md` with Slidev for presentations
   - Slides optimized for various screen sizes with two-column layouts
   - Includes Carbon icons for better visual presentation
3. Live code using files in `/demos/`
4. Students work on `/exercises/` files
5. Reference `/solutions/` as needed

### Slide Presentation Setup
- Install Slidev globally: `npm install -g @slidev/cli`
- Install Carbon icons globally: `npm install -g @carbon/icons`
- Run presentation: `slidev slides.md`
- Recent improvements: All tables and long content use two-column layouts for better screen fit

### VS Code Project Setup
1. Create new folder for your project
2. Open folder in VS Code
3. Create `src/` folder for source files
4. VS Code will automatically compile to `bin/`
5. Ensure Extension Pack for Java is installed

### Testing Approach
The course uses simple main method tests instead of JUnit to:
- Avoid external dependencies
- Reduce complexity for beginners
- Work in restricted environments
- Focus on Java fundamentals

### Tips for Banking/Enterprise Environments
- All code runs with standard Java 17, no external dependencies
- No internet access required during course
- No build tools needed (Maven/Gradle)
- All materials are self-contained

## Quick Start for Students

1. Open VS Code
2. Create a new folder named "JavaTraining"
3. Open the folder in VS Code (File â†’ Open Folder)
4. Create a `src/` subfolder and copy exercise files there
5. Start with `Exercise1_SimpleFunctions.java`
6. Run files with F5 (debug) or Ctrl+F5 (run without debug)

## Distribution

Two ZIP files are created by the `CREATE_ZIP.sh` script:
- `java-training-student-materials.zip` - Contains exercises, demos, and setup docs (no solutions)
- `java-training-instructor-materials.zip` - Contains everything including solutions and slides
